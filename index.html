      <h2 style="text-align: center">We Put You First</h2>
      <p>As a professional real estate buyer I've learned that the only way to earn your trust is by working hard and keeping my promises. I buy houses from people in Denver and Fort Collins who are looking for an alternative to listing with a realtor on the MLS </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center">Get A No Obligation Cash Offer</h2>
      <p>We know that selliing your home can be stressful. Allow us to see if we can help make the process easier for you. If your home meets our criteria we'll make you an absolutely free no obligation offer</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center">No Commissions</h2>
      <p>Instead of putting your house on the market and waiting weeks for a buyer then paying thousands of dollars in commisions and fees you can get a no-obligation cash offer from us.</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center">We Buy As-Is</h2>
      <p>Having to keep your house in 'selling condition' or make make repairs so that you can constantly be ready to show it, then hoping that one of those buyers will qualify for a loan can be a pain. We buy as-is. We see beyond the repairs and dirt</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center">We Can Close Fast And On Your Time Schedule</h2>
      <p>Why wait 90 days or more to get to the closing table? In some cases we can close in as fast as 7 days from the time that our offer is accepted.</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: center">Our Integrity</h2>
      <p>I'm involved in every sale. I genuinely want to help you get out of a painful situation.</p>
